# Sskki's Obsidian CSS Snippets
Some CSS snippets I wrote, that I like to use.

### Heatmap Alternating Months
Before | <img width="681" height="143" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5add84b9-863c-4adf-928b-4f92336eef53" />
--- | ---
**After** | <img width="701" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d73635-a0e5-4af1-904a-675470d931ec" />

- Adds alternating colors to empty cells in heatmaps
- Labels every day of the week instead of only 3
- Highlights today better

### Inline Title Color
Before | <img height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdb92810-5341-4ed6-8fd8-43ddca7f49a5" />
--- | ---
**After** | <img height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c67e90f-ee38-4487-b3a7-710702baef78" />

- File names are shown as an inline title
- Because of the theme I use, it is colored red by default
- This changes it back to white

### No Title Embeds
Before | After
--- | ---
<img width="249" height="51" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a0bad2-8658-4e79-a0ef-2e5bb26211a6" /> | <img width="243" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05572f68-40a3-4435-8d41-721ebf8f423c" />

### Table Highlight
