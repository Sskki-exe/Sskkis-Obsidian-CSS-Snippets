# Sskki's Obsidian CSS Snippets
Some CSS snippets I wrote, that I like to use.
### Heatmap Alternating Months
- Adds alternating colors to empty cells in heatmaps
- Labels every day of the week instead of only 3
- Highlights today better

### Inline Title Color
- File names are shown as an inline title
- Because of the theme I use, it is colored red by default
- This changes it back to white

### No Title Embeds
- Does what it says on the tin

### Table Highlight
- Remove line break before tables
	- Not sure why they're there in the first place
- Remove bold from first row
- Highlight cells with bold or italics in them
	- Color the cell lightgrey
	- Color the text black

### Tasks Columns
- Organise task queries into multiple columns
